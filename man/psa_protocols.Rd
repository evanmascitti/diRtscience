\format{
Data frame or tibble containing several list columns.

psa_protocols
}
\description{
Detailed information about specimen pretreatement, dispersion,
and measurements.
}
\details{
Each list item contains details about how the test was performed. Called
internally by \code{\link[=psa]{psa()}} and useful for reference during data analysis and for
reproducibility of results by different operators.

This list can be easily extended because each protocol has a unique ID.
Each ID (i.e. object name) is a number enclosed in backticks. This allows
unlimited expansion (letters could conceivably be exhausted).
