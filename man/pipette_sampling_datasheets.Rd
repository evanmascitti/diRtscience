\arguments{
\item{date}{Character. Date test was \strong{begun} by weighing air-dry specimens,
ISO YYYY-MM-DD format}

\item{experiment_name}{Character, length 1. Experiment with which the samples
are associated.}

\item{sample_names}{Character. Unique identifiers for the samples tested (for
example, "EPK kaolin").}

\item{n_reps}{Integer, length 1. Number of replicate specimens tested per
sample}

\item{fines_diameters_sampled}{numeric vector of particle diameters which will be sampled}

\item{beaker_tare_set}{unique identifier to write into sheets;
used by \code{\link[=psa]{psa()}}}

\item{sample_beaker_numbers}{integer vector of beaker numbers from relevant set}

\item{...}{arguments passed via call to \code{\link[=psa_datasheets]{psa_datasheets()}}}

\value{
a list of two data sheets, one for the actual sampling and one for
the blank correction

\details{
If a continuous sequence of beaker numbers is used (the usual case), it is
helpful to set the \code{sample_beaker_numbers} argument to a numeric vector including
these. If no numbers are given, this column defaults to empty and the
numbers must be inputted manually after the file is generated. For example,
if 3 specimens are being tested and the sampled particle diameters are 20,
5, 2, and 0.2 Î¼, the user should use \code{sample_beaker_numbers = 1:12}. The
blank should essentially be considered a separate analysis; in other words,
its beaker numbers should not be interspersed within the sample beakers'
sequence.
