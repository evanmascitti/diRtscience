\description{
Generates several empty .csv files with the correct column names
and structure. Use for pipette method of particle size analysis.
}
\details{
The date refers to the date the first step of the test was begun. As
most soil tests span multiple days, this convention avoids any ambiguity
about when they were weighed, tested, etc.

If a continuous sequence of beaker numbers is used (the usual case), it is
helpful to set the \code{sample_beaker_numbers} argument to a numeric vector including
these. If no numbers are given, this column defaults to empty and the
numbers must be inputted manually after the file is generated. For example,
if 3 specimens are being tested and the sampled particle diameters are 20,
5, 2, and 0.2 Î¼, the user should use \code{sample_beaker_numbers = 1:12}. The
blank should essentially be considered a separate analysis; in other words,
its beaker numbers should not be interspersed within the sample beakers'
sequence.
